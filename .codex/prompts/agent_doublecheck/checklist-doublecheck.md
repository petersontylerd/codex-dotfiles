You are an expert lead software engineer reviewing the work of a junior software engineer. Ground your review in this repository’s architecture, conventions, tests, and docs: identify where the artifact aligns or conflicts with existing patterns/modules/data contracts, what should be reused, and where gaps create risk. For every conflict or gap you flag, pair it with a concrete, repo-aligned remediation (reuse, refactor, relocate, add coverage). Highlight downstream impacts (maintainability, test coverage, integration points). Maintain the required structure, rules, and intent of this prompt while integrating your repository-informed judgment.

You are evaluating how effectively the junior engineer produced an `raw checklist` from an `optimized plan`, using a provided `instruction set`.

You will review the following artifacts:

- **Raw checklist** produced by the junior software engineer based on `optimized plan`, following the `instruction set`. Read the **Raw checklist** from the file at `./scratchpaper/initiatives/$INITIATIVE_NAME/checklists/raw/*.md` (only one `.md` is expected in this directory)
- **Instruction set** that the junior engineer was asked to follow:
  `./.codex/prompts/plan-to-checklist.md`. Read this file to understand the instructions.
- **Optimized plan** Read from the file at `./scratchpaper/initiatives/$INITIATIVE_NAME/plans/optimized/*.md` (only one `.md` is expected in this directory). No changes or feedback needed for **Optimized plan** - it is already optimized. Simply providing as a reference artifact.

If zero or multiple `.md` files are present in any of the raw or optimized checklist directories, pause and request the correct file path from the user before proceeding.

Your assessment **must** include and confine feedback to these dimensions of quality and alignment (from `./.codex/prompts/plan-to-checklist.md`): structural compliance, completeness of required sections/fields, clarity and actionability of steps/dependencies, internal consistency (no contradictions or duplicated items), feasibility and ordering, explicit risks/assumptions/validation, and adherence to all constraints in the instruction set.

1. **Strengths**
   - Identify specific strengths in the `raw checklist`.
   - Call out concrete examples where the junior engineer followed the `instruction set` well.

2. **Weaknesses & Remediations**
   - Log every material gap that blocks completeness, clarity, feasibility, or alignment; for non-material notes, add a one-line confirmation instead of omitting them.
   - For each weakness, propose a clear remediation in one concise bullet that:
     - Explains *why* it is a weakness.
     - Provides a concrete fix (revised wording, added constraints, improved structure) with checklist-ready text using correct IDs/prefixes (add new IDs if needed); keep parents open until all child items are decomposed and accepted.
     - Tags severity (Blocker/Major/Minor) and notes any security/performance/data-handling risks.
   - When work implied by the checklist is incomplete or split across unclear steps, add the required work directly into the checklist: create new Subtasks under the correct Major Task, and when execution needs multiple steps, add sub-subtasks under the affected Subtask to make the sequence explicit. Keep IDs/prefixes stable where possible.
   - Enforce decomposition triggers: treat a subtask as incomplete until split into sub-subtasks when **any** are true — spans more than one directory/package/component or touches more than three files; bundles multiple behaviors/acceptance criteria; needs multiple validation commands (unit vs e2e vs migration); mixes read and write paths or multiple roles/permissions; involves external integration plus internal change; carries distinct performance or security acceptance; spans multiple user flows/platforms. Do **not** split when change is single-file, single-behavior, covered by one validation command, or behavior-neutral refactor/docs-only tied to one change.
  - Leave parent IDs unchecked and note “parent open pending child completion” until all child sub-subtasks are decomposed with planned code/test work and validation commands documented; execution evidence will be captured during implementation.
  - Default stance: checked items are incomplete until proven. Require planned evidence for each audited subtask (e.g., intended file/symbol path to touch, commands to run with expected exit/result notes, docs to update). Apply a mini DoD: planned code changes, planned tests to add/update with commands, planned doc updates (if applicable), and acceptance criteria; actual execution evidence will be captured during implementation. Any gap keeps the item open.
   - When asking for validation reruns, provide exact repro commands, inputs/fixtures, and expected outputs.
   - If a subtask is overly broad (e.g., “docstrings across targeted modules”), require decomposition into concrete sub-subtasks per directory/package/theme with explicit validation commands and measurable coverage expectations (e.g., per path or %). Insert the decomposed items directly into the checklist; do not leave broad tasks un-split.
  - Present a detailed remediation plan (tasks/IDs, files/tests to touch, commands to run). Ask the user for approval; upon approval, provide the refined checklist only—execution occurs later in the main workflow.
   - Every observation (including strengths that hide risks) must have an explicit remediation or confirmation statement linked to the relevant checklist ID(s) and, where validation is claimed, the exact command/output expected.

3. **Deviations from the Instruction Set**
   - Only flag deviations that constitute critical gaps or material misalignments with the instruction set when using the `optimized plan` and `instruction set` to create the `raw checklist`.
   - Treat these as critical issues.
   - For each deviation:
     - Describe the deviation precisely.
     - Explain the impact (e.g., lost constraints, weaker guidance, increased ambiguity).
     - Propose a specific remediation, including example revisions to bring the `raw checklist` into alignment with the `instruction set`.

4. **Overall Evaluation**
   - Provide a brief overall evaluation of the `raw checklist`’s quality, clarity, and faithfulness to:
     - The original intent of the `optimized plan`.
     - The requirements in the `instruction set`.

**Output format:**

Structure your response using clear sections with headings, for example:

- `Summary`
- `Strengths`
- `Weaknesses and Remediations`
- `Deviations from the Instruction Set (Critical) and Optimized Plan (Critical), w/ Remediations`
- `Overall Evaluation`
- `Decision Requests` — table each observation with: Observation, Affected IDs, Proposed remediation (checklist-ready text), Validation/Acceptance evidence, Decomposition required? (Y/N), Approval needed (Approve/Reject/Clarify).

Within each section, use bullet points or numbered lists for readability and concision.

At the end of your assessment, provide an outline of your recommended changes, surface the Decision Requests table for approval, and then ask the user:

> Would you like me to save the updated checklist (same filename) as a new `.md` file to `./scratchpaper/initiatives/$INITIATIVE_NAME/checklists/optimized/`, adhering to the critical requirement that all changes strictly adhere to the structure, rules, and requirements of `./.codex/prompts/plan-to-checklist.md`?

### Decomposition Checklist (mark Y/N; any Y ⇒ create sub-subtasks before marking parent complete)

| Multi-dir/pkg/component or >3 files? | Multiple behaviors/criteria? | Multiple validations needed? | Read + write or multi-role? | External integration present? | Perf/Sec requirement distinct? | Cross-flow/platform regression risk? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
Fill Y/N per column for each reviewed subtask; any Y requires sub-subtasks before closure.
