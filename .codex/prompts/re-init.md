Update all `AGENTS.md` files in the project to accurately reflect the current state of the codebase and its agents.

Your tasks:

1. **Root `AGENTS.md`**

   * Review the existing root-level `AGENTS.md`.
   * Propose and apply any necessary refinements (additions, edits, or deletions) to:

     * Clarify the overall agent architecture and responsibilities.
     * Remove stale or misleading information.
     * Add any missing agents or behaviors that now exist in the project.

2. **Existing `AGENTS.md` Files in Subdirectories**

   * Discover all existing `AGENTS.md` files throughout the project.
   * For each one:

     * Update the content to match the current implementation and purpose of that subdirectory.
     * Perform additions, edits, or deletions as needed to keep the documentation accurate, concise, and useful.

3. **New `AGENTS.md` Files Where Needed**

   * Identify any subdirectories that would benefit from their own `AGENTS.md` (for example, areas with distinct agents, workflows, or responsibilities).
   * For each such subdirectory:

     * Create a new `AGENTS.md` file.
     * Author clear, tailored documentation that describes:

       * The agents present in that subdirectory.
       * Their roles, responsibilities, and key interactions.
       * Any important configuration, conventions, or usage notes relevant to that area.

Ensure all `AGENTS.md` files are:

* Consistent in structure and tone.
* Up to date with the current code.
* Helpful to developers trying to understand or modify the agents in that part of the project.
