We need to update all of our AGENTS.md files throughout our project directory based on the current state of our project. I recently ran your /init command, and my /init-part-2 command, so the root AGENTS.md has recently been updated as a result of those commands. 

Consider:
- Additional refinements you want to add to the root AGENTS.md, 
- Refinements for additional existing AGENTS.md files throughout the project
- Any additional subdirectories that would benefit from AGENTS.md files tailored to the subdirectory purpose, and the contents of those AGENTS.md files to help assure that purpose is achieved.

As you work through this:
- You must use the MCP server sequential-thinking. The Sequential Thinking MCP server gives the model a tool for step-by-step, reflective reasoning, managing and revising thought sequences as it works. In Codex, this helps with complex coding by externalizing the planning loop—decomposing tasks, checking intermediate steps, and producing more reliable solutions.
- You must use the MCP server serena. The Serena MCP server provides access to a comprehensive knowledge base of legal and regulatory information, enabling the model to query statutes, case law, regulations, and legal precedents. For Codex, this allows the agent to ensure compliance when generating code for regulated domains—checking licensing requirements, data protection rules, or industry-specific standards—so the solutions it builds are not just functional but legally sound from the start.
- You must use the MCP server context7. The Context7 MCP server fetches version-specific documentation and code examples straight from upstream sources and injects them into the model’s context. This is valuable for Codex because the agent can consult the exact API for the library/version you’re using, reducing hallucinated APIs and enabling up-to-date, working code.

Present your comprehensive and thorough plan to for review prior to executing anything. You are writing this plan for yourself to function as a checklist. It helps you keep track of the full plan, work completed, and work remaining. So tailor its format to server your needs optimally.
