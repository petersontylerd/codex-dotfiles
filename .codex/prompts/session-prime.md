## üß† Agentic Coding Session: Context Priming and Alignment
---

We are beginning a new **agentic coding session**, and your first task is to fully **prime your context** by understanding our existing work and plans.

At every step of this process:

> ‚ùó **If you encounter uncertainty, ambiguity, or missing information, pause and ask clarifying questions before proceeding.**
> This includes uncertainty about intent, file interpretations, inferred logic, or next-step prioritization.

---

### **Step 1: Review and Outline the Product Blueprint**

1. Review the complete contents of
   `/home/ubuntu/repos/legacy_kpi_control_tower_demo_ado/scratchpaper/blueprint`.
2. After your review, produce a **detailed and structured outline** of the product plan:

   * Use bullet points and nested sub-bullets to capture hierarchy and relationships.
   * Cover the plan comprehensively from end to end ‚Äî technical, functional, and conceptual aspects.
3. Present this outline for my review and approval before proceeding.
   ‚è∏ **Pause after submitting the outline** until I confirm it‚Äôs accurate or provide adjustments.
   ‚ùì **If any aspect of the blueprint is unclear or appears incomplete, ask specific questions** before finalizing your outline.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze Repository Progress**

1. Once I approve your Step 1 outline, review the repository:
   `/home/ubuntu/repos/legacy_kpi_control_tower_demo_ado`

   * **Exclude** the directories: `.claude/`, `.codex/`.
2. Reconcile the repository contents against the approved blueprint:

   * For each section of the plan, explain **which parts are already implemented**.
   * Include:

     * Specific technical implementations and code references.
     * File names or paths.
     * Design choices and their rationale.
     * A plain-language explanation of how each implementation supports the overall plan.
3. Present this progress analysis for my review and approval.
   ‚ùì **If you are uncertain how a piece of code relates to the plan, or if multiple interpretations are possible, explicitly ask before making assumptions.**

---

### **Step 3: Identify and Assess Blueprint Deviations**

1. After I approve your Repository Progress Analysis, **reconcile** the implementation findings from Step 2 against the blueprint outline from Step 1.
2. Identify any **deviations** or **inconsistencies**, such as:

   * Implementations that differ from or expand beyond the original blueprint.
   * Missing components or features that were planned but not yet addressed.
   * Design or architectural changes made during development that diverge from the original intent.
3. For each deviation:

   * Explain **why** it occurred (if inferable).
   * Assess whether the blueprint should be **updated** to reflect this evolved understanding, or whether the repository should be **refactored** to realign with the blueprint.
4. Summarize your reconciliation in a structured format:

   * **Deviation summary table or outline** (Blueprint Element ‚Üí Observed Implementation ‚Üí Recommended Adjustment).
   * A brief **recommendation summary** outlining next steps for alignment.
5. Present this reconciliation report for my review and approval.
   ‚ùì **If you are unsure whether to favor blueprint modification or repository refactoring, ask before recommending a direction.**

---

### **Step 4: Define Next Development Tasks**

1. After I approve your deviation reconciliation, identify the **next 10 development tasks** needed to advance the project.
2. For each task, include:

   * **Technical approach:** What specific implementation steps or changes are needed.
   * **Detailed design:** File locations, function or module-level detail where applicable.
   * **Plain-language purpose:** What this task contributes to the overall system or roadmap.
3. Present your proposed task list for my review and approval.
   ‚ùì **If priorities or dependencies are ambiguous, request clarification before finalizing the list.**

---

### **Step 5: Update the Task Checklist**

1. Once I approve the task plan, update the file:
   `/home/ubuntu/repos/legacy_kpi_control_tower_demo_ado/scratchpaper/backlog/task_checklist.md`
2. Add each of the 10 tasks as **unchecked items** in the checklist.
3. Write the task entries in a way that helps **you (the agent)** clearly understand:

   * What the task involves.
   * What conditions define its completion.
4. Before writing to the checklist, ‚ùì **confirm with me if any part of the task structure, scope, or phrasing is unclear.**

---

‚úÖ **Goal:**
By following these steps, you will:

* Reestablish full working context.
* Confirm project alignment.
* Identify any blueprint deviations.
* Set up a prioritized, executable backlog for the next phase of development.

At all times, prioritize **clarity and communication** ‚Äî ask questions rather than make assumptions.

Would you like me to make this version slightly more **concise for use as a system prompt** (optimized for LLM execution), or keep it in this **explicitly instructive format** (optimized for human review and team alignment)?
