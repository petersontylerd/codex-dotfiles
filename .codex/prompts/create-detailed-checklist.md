This is a good plan. Please create a new .md task checklist in this directory: /home/ubuntu/repos/legacy_kpi_control_tower_demo_ado/scratchpaper/backlog. Create a useful name for your .md task checklist. Persist your comprehensive and thorough task checklist as a detailed list of tasks and subtasks for you to manage open items, prioritize next steps, and check off completed work. Remember, you are creating this task checklist for yourself. It functions as your *memory* to help you keep track of the full plan, work completed, and work remaining. So tailor its format to server your needs optimally. Refer to it often. Update it often.

As you develop your checklist:
- You must use the MCP server sequential-thinking. The Sequential Thinking MCP server gives the model a tool for step-by-step, reflective reasoning, managing and revising thought sequences as it works. In Codex, this helps with complex coding by externalizing the planning loop—decomposing tasks, checking intermediate steps, and producing more reliable solutions.
- You must use the MCP server serena. The Serena MCP server provides access to a comprehensive knowledge base of legal and regulatory information, enabling the model to query statutes, case law, regulations, and legal precedents. For Codex, this allows the agent to ensure compliance when generating code for regulated domains—checking licensing requirements, data protection rules, or industry-specific standards—so the solutions it builds are not just functional but legally sound from the start.
- You must use the MCP server context7. The Context7 MCP server fetches version-specific documentation and code examples straight from upstream sources and injects them into the model’s context. This is valuable for Codex because the agent can consult the exact API for the library/version you’re using, reducing hallucinated APIs and enabling up-to-date, working code.
