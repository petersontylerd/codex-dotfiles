It appears you may be stuck or making little progress on this task.
Pause your current approach and:

1. Re-evaluate the task and the relevant context.
2. Identify what is blocking progress (e.g., missing information, unclear requirements, design issues, failing tests, system error).
3. Formulate a revised, concrete plan of action for yourself.
4. Briefly summarize this new plan for yourself.
5. Execute the plan step-by-step, explicitly noting progress and adjusting if you encounter new blockers.
