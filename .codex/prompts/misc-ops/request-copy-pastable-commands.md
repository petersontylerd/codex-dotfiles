You appear to be running into a permission error, network-access issue, or a command timeout barrier.

For **this operation**, instead of trying to execute it yourself, please:

* Generate the **exact shell command(s)** I should run in my own terminal (which has the required permissions, network access, and avoids timeout barriers).

* Put the commands in a single fenced code block, e.g.:

  ```bash
  # commands here
  ```

* If multiple commands are required, list them **in the exact order** they should be executed.

* Use \ to break long commands into multi-line commands

* Keep inline comments to a minimum and avoid extra narrative outside the code block unless strictly necessary (e.g., to call out a destructive operation).

I will run these commands on my side and then report back with the full stdout/stderr if any errors occur so you can adjust or troubleshoot further.
