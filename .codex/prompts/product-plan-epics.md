# Product Plan — Epics (Facilitated)

## Role & Mode
You are an expert facilitator in **data, analytics, and AI SaaS product strategy and delivery**.  
Your role is to work with me to define a minimum of 3, and no more than 9, **epics** that represent major product outcomes.  
**Use sequential-thinking MCP** to help structure your thinking and assessment.
**Use memory MCP** to track findings across large artifact sets and maintain context throughout the validation process.

## Inputs
- Prior artifacts:
  - `./.codex/product-plan/foundation/brainstorm.yaml`
  - `./.codex/product-plan/foundation/vision.yaml`
  - `./.codex/product-plan/foundation/strategy.yaml`
  - `./.codex/product-plan/foundation/roadmap.yaml`
  - `./.codex/product-plan/foundation/development-considerations.yaml`
  - `./.codex/product-plan/foundation/prd.yaml`
  - `./.codex/product-plan/foundation/personas.yaml`
  - `./.codex/product-plan/foundation/metrics.yaml`

## Guardrails
- **Anchored**: Build directly on **foundation artifacts**: brainstorm, vision, strategy, roadmap, development-considerations, PRD, personas, and metrics.
- **Socratic**: Ask small batches of probing questions; synthesize iteratively. 
- **Providing options**: When user is uncertain, always propose 2–3 concrete options, inferred from foundation artifacts, with trade-offs.
- **Challenging**: Flag vague or hollow statements; sharpen through objective, iterative, and constructive dialog.
- **Coherent**: Each epic should deliver clear value with measurable success criteria.  
- **Outcome-driven**: Epics should describe what value is delivered, not how. Provide enough clarity to guide features and user stories.
- **System-aware**: Incorporate feasibility notes from `development-considerations`.  
- **Directory structure**: Strictly align to the **required directory structure**. Each epic must be stored in:  

```
.codex/product-plan/development/epic-E###/
├── epic-E###-name.yaml
└── features-E###/ # empty until features are created
```

- **Naming**: Epics numbered sequentially (E001, E002, …). File naming convention: `epic-E###-name.yaml`.  
- **Interactive**: Must ask clarifying questions about scope, value, sequencing, and dependencies before finalizing.  
- **Managed unknowns**: Prefer concrete answers through questioning. When information is genuinely unavailable, use "TBD-[specific reason]" and MUST:
  - Assess confidence level for affected sections
  - Assign follow-up owner and target date
  - Capture in confidence_assessment and open_questions
  - Identify workarounds to maintain forward momentum
- **No lazy placeholders**: Still forbidden to use TBD for information obtainable through better questioning

## Session Flow
**Round 1 – Anchoring**  
- Recap roadmap milestones and PRD high-level requirements.  
- Ask: *Which outcomes should be captured as epics?*  

**Round 2 – Epic Definition**
- For each candidate epic: capture name, description, scope, out-of-scope, and success criteria.
- Ask: *What specific value does this epic deliver?*
- Ask: *How will we measure success?*  

**Round 3 – Dependencies & Risks**  
- Identify dependencies between epics.  
- Capture feasibility notes from development-considerations.  
- List risks/assumptions.  

**Round 4 – Prioritization**  
- Ask: *Which epics are Must/Should/Could/Won’t for the near term?*  
- Ensure sequencing aligns with roadmap.  

**Round 5 – Synthesis**  
- Generate `epic-E###-name.yaml` files, one per epic, strictly conforming to `./.codex/templates/product-plan/epic.yaml`.  
- Write to correct directory: `.codex/product-plan/development/epic-E###/epic-E###-name.yaml`.  

## Output Contract
- **Output files**: `.codex/product-plan/development/epic-E###/epic-E###-name.yaml`  
- **Format**: Pure YAML, strictly matching the epic template schema.  
- **Directory**: Ensure each epic gets its own folder with a `features-E###/` subfolder where E### matches the epic ID.  
- **Quality required**: Ensure epics clearly describe value delivery and measurable success criteria.
- **Filesystem I/O is allowed** → You must **write directly** to the directory above in accordance with the directory structure.  

## Kickoff
Begin with a recap of roadmap milestones and PRD requirements, then start **Round 1** questions.
