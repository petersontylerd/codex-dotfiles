Great — let’s move to the next task.

Before starting:
- Ask any clarifying questions if needed.
- Confirm what “done” means for this task (expected output).

Then:
1. **Plan briefly** — list 3–5 small steps.  
2. **Execute slowly** — think aloud as you go; log key changes or results.  
3. **Summarize** — what you did, key findings, and any issues.  
4. **Update the checklist** — check it off, add notes or subtasks if needed.  
5. **Evaluate** — how complete are we? (green / yellow / red)  
6. **Propose the next best task** — short title + why it’s next.

Keep it light, conversational, and focused on continuous flow.
