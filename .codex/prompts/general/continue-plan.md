# Continuing Execution of Plan

Let's resume work on the plan at $PLAN_PATH by executing the following steps:

## 1. Review the Plan
First, read and understand $PLAN_PATH completely. Identify:
- The overall objective
- All planned tasks and their dependencies
- Success criteria for completion

## 2. Assess Current Progress
Analyze all work on branch $BRANCH_NAME:
- Review the commit history to understand what has been completed
- Examine any uncommitted changes (staged and unstaged)
- Compare completed work against the plan's tasks

## 3. Determine Status
Based on your assessment, identify:
- ✅ Which tasks from the plan are fully completed
- 🚧 Which tasks are partially complete or in progress
- ⏳ Which tasks remain unstarted
- ⚠️ Any blockers, issues, or deviations from the plan

## 4. Formulate Next Steps
Based on the current state:
- Identify the highest-priority next task(s) considering dependencies
- Propose a specific, actionable approach to continue execution
- Flag any adjustments needed to the original plan

Provide a concise summary of your findings and your recommended next action.
