1. Read `MASTER_AGENTS.md` and copy its entire contents (including the `# MASTER_AGENTS.md` heading).
2. Open `AGENTS.md` and insert that copied content at the very top of the file so the existing contents move down unchanged.
3. Save `AGENTS.md` with the `MASTER_AGENTS.md` text prepended.
4. Show the resulting `AGENTS.md` header section so the user can confirm the merge.
